# 3.7 Developing Algorithms

## Users will be able to:

* [ ] Develop an algorithm using Strings
* [ ] Develop an algorithm with Integers
* [ ] Find if one or more substrings has specific properties
* [ ] Create new Strings in reverse
* [ ] Effectively use Wrapper Classes

## Prior Knowledge

* Objects and Methods
* Conditionals, booleans, operators
* for and while loops

## Planning Overview

> Consider having learners whiteboard the problems. As concepts become more abstract some learners will struggle more than others.

## Standards Alignment

* 2C-AP-14-  Determine the result or output based on the statement execution order in a code segment containing method calls
* 3C-AP-10- Use and adapt classic algorithms to solve computational problems
* 3C-AP-11- Write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements
